🏥 Health Center Churn Analysis
This project analyzes patient churn at a community health center to identify key risk factors and support data-driven retention strategies.

🔍 Problem Statement
Many patients stop visiting the clinic over time, affecting care continuity and planning. This project identifies churn patterns and builds a dashboard to support targeted actions.

📊 Tools & Libraries
Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib (for EDA)
Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration and documentation
Tableau Public: For final dashboard visualization
🧠 Key Steps
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Churn risk factor identification
Dashboard creation in Tableau
📈 Sample Insights (optional)
Patients with infrequent visits over 6 months are more likely to churn.
Certain demographics (e.g. age 60+) have higher retention with consistent follow-ups.
